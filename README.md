In this week's assignment, we were tasked with creating a professional portfolio from scratch, generating our own HTML and CSS using skills we have learned so far. I chose to construct my page in sections, first staring with the HTML for a particular portion of the page, then adding in the CSS. I began as most do with a header that contained my name and a nav bar that scrolls to the corresponding section on the page when clicked. Below are the HTML and CSS for my header:

Next was the main section of my page which included three sections: an "About Me" that briefly introduced who I am, a "My Work" section that contains placeholders for the time being since I don't have a wide body of work just yet, and a "Contact Me" section containing ways to reach me. The most challenging part of this main section was definitely the "My Work" portion as I had many things to account for such as imbedding links into the HTML that actually went somewhere as well as styling the placeholder images so they fit nicely on the page at any resolution. Here is the completed HTML and CSS for the elements in the "My Work" section of my page:

By far, the most challenging part of this entire assignment was making sure my page could be accessed from any device, be it a computer or mobile device. I had to make sure that everything on my page was still visible on smaller screens and everything stayed in the correct place. After tweaking the widths and margins of several elements of the page, I finally got it to look the way I wanted it using media queries in my CSS. This is final CSS for that part:
